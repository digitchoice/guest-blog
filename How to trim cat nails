How to trim cat nails

For many domestic cats, nail trimming is a must. Growing nails make animals uncomfortable. If they are not trimmed in time, inflammation can occur. However, you should prepare for the cat "manicure" and study the technique of its performance. Then the procedure will be carried out with minimal stress and will not cause the cat pain.
Does the cat need to have its nails trimmed?
Domestic cats often have claws that grow longer than necessary. In addition, such pets walk on soft surfaces most of the time. Of course, you can buy a scratching post, but this measure is not always enough.
 
Many owners shorten the claws so that the cat will not scratch and spoil the furniture less. Also, clipping is desirable if several pets live in the house. During games or fights, they can injure each other.

Trimming the claws of a cat that walks freely in the street is not necessary. Instead, it needs feet to climb trees, hunt, and defend itself from other four-legged animals.
 
Also, the procedure is not performed on kittens under 1 month of age. This is because their claws are not yet formed. In addition, early clipping negatively affects the structure of the nail plate and leads to delamination.
